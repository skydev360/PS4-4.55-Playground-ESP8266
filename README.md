PS4 4.55 Playground for ESP8266. Just a simple playground for ppl to exploit their hackable PS4.

New V3 :

    Eliminate the use of image to reduce webpage load time
    Need to change the payload to wildemodez's payload cuz lamance's size is too big 
    Fix Original exploit

New V2 :
    
    New SSID : "ESPlayground"
    Removed password! :p Just select AP on setting without password
    Added 4.05 payload
    Removed Spoofer payload
    Added HEN-VR payload
    Not much style on playground as it will take more time to load on PS4 
    
V2 Payload include :

    HEN v1.4 - vortex 
    Linux loader - vultra
    Dumper v1.7 - vortex 
    App2Usb v15 - stooged

    Original - qwertyuiop
    Spoofer 5.50 - majrawi
